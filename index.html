    <h1>iOS App Access Automation</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        Apple restricts devices from installing and using apps from outside its official app market, App Store, without establishing a form of trust between the device and the app’s developer through the Apple Developer Program. Firebase simplifies this process.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, even with Firebase, allowing users to download an iOS app from Firebase is still a very complicated process. When a user registers their device with Firebase to request access to the app, it can take up to 24 hours for developers to complete the necessary work to allow the users to download the app, especially when there’s a timezone difference.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project aims to solve this problem by automating the work required on the developer’s side to grant access to the app after a user registers their device with Firebase.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works for Users</h2>
    <p>
        Once this project is functional, users will only need to wait approximately 1 hour after registering their device with Firebase, after which they will receive an email from Firebase that informs the build is ready to be downloaded and installed.
    </p>
    <h2>Personal Goal</h2>
    <p>
        Estimating something unknown has always been problematic for me. Sometimes, I estimate 16 hours and it's done in 4 hours. Sometimes, it's the other way around. This makes stakeholders unhappy because it's difficult for them to manage project timelines.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project is being carried out with a focus on figuring out what can be done to address this weakness of mine and applying the findings along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
        All lessons learned so far are highlighted under the section titled "Lesson Learned".
    </p>
    <h2>Project Timeline</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Start Date:</strong> 16 Dec 2024</li>
        <li><strong>Expected Completion Date:</strong> 31 Jan 2025</li>
        <li><strong>Working Hours a Week:</strong> 10 hours</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>The project has three main components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>iOSAppInviteAlert</strong></li>
        <li><strong>iOSAppAccessAutomation</strong></li>
        <li><strong>iOS Build GitHub Workflow</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Firebase (App Distribution)</strong> and <strong>Apple Developer Account (via Apple Connect API)</strong> are external parties where no coding is required.</p>
    </p>

    <h2>Project Revision</h2>
    <p>Initially, it was designed to update the provisioning profile from the Firebase Cloud Function but later, it was found that Apple Connect API does not support updating provisioning profile. It only provides APIs for creating and deleting.</p> 
    <p>Because of it, it's decided to create a new provisioning profile for every build using Github Workflow instead.</p>
    <p>Creating a provisioning profile returns the created provisioning profile as part of the response. Therefore, the task number 3 in the Task Breakdown was discarded.</p>
    <p>The task number 7 is also canceled but because the time spent on this task revealed the missing information that led to this revision, it's still marked as 1 hour spent on this task.</p>
    <p>This revision increased the project timeline by 13 hours.</p>
    <p>The discarded initial design can be found <a href="images/diagram.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The revision happened because during the design task, an API was planned to be used without knowing whether such API even exists or not. Just because downloading, creating and deleting exist, updating cannot be assumed to be there too.
        </li>
        <li>
            Estimation is easier when a big task is broken down into smaller ones. It makes it a lot easier to estimate and makes the estimations more accurate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dedicating a certain amount of time specifically for researching what needs to be done helps making unknowns knowns and helps with estimation. Such research work should always be done first before estimating anything for projects that involve unknowns.
