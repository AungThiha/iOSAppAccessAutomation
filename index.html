    <h1>iOS App Access Automation</h1>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
        Allowing users to download an iOS app from Firebase is a very complicated process. When a user registers their device with Firebase to request access to the app, it can take up to 24 hours for developers to complete the necessary work to allow the users to download the app, especially when there’s a timezone difference.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project aims to solve this problem by automating the work required on the developer’s side to grant access to the app after a user registers their device with Firebase.
    </p>

    <h2>How It Works for Users</h2>
    <p>
        Once this project is functional, users will need to wait 1 hour after registering their device with Firebase, after which a redacted version of their email address will appear on this page to indicate they're ready to download the app.
    </p>
    <h2>Status</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This project will start on <strong>16 Dec 2024</strong>.</li>
        <li>Expected completion date will be posted on <strong>18 Dec 2024</strong>. That is not the date the project will complete; that's the date when the updated plan will be posted.</li>
