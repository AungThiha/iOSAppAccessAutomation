    <h1>iOS App Access Automation</h1>

    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
    <p>Apple restricts devices from installing and using apps from outside its official app market, App Store, without establishing a form of trust between the device and the app’s developer through the Apple Developer Program. Firebase simplifies this process.</p>
    <p>However, when there’s a timezone difference, it can take up to 24 hours until the users can install the app.</p>
    <p>This project aims to solve this problem by automating the work required on the developer’s side to grant access to the app after a user registers their device with Firebase.</p>
    <h2 id="justification">Justification</h2>
    <p>There’s no question whether automating the process of building and distributing is worth it because doing it manually would cost a substantial amount of time to make small releases necessary for identifying issues early.</p>
    <p>However, automating the registration of device UDIDs may not be necessary for every projects as it does not take no more than 10 minutes per device. Likewise, the email list required by the Firebase CLI for distribution can be stored as a simple text file in the git repository itself. So, adding a new email should also take no more than 10 minutes. Therefore, the total time investment per user would only be about 20 minutes. Even for 100 devices, the total cost would accumulate to just 33 hours (20 minutes × 100 devices / 60).</p>
    <p>The reason this project automates these processes is that <a href="https://github.com/AungThiha/PhotoAlbumKMP" target="_blank">the KMP project</a> was submitted as part of a university assignment. Since the university is in the UK and I live in Thailand, the timezone difference would cause delays for the reviewers. Furthermore, it is not known who will review my assignment or when. This makes it essential to automate all the work required to enable app access to the reviewers.</p>
    <h2>How It Works for Users</h2>
    <p>
        Once this project is functional, users will only need to wait approximately 1 hour after registering their device with Firebase, after which they will receive an email from Firebase that informs the build is ready to be downloaded and installed.
    </p>
    <h2>Personal Goal</h2>
    <p>
        Estimating something unknown has always been problematic for me. Sometimes, I estimate 16 hours and it's done in 4 hours. Sometimes, it's the other way around. This makes stakeholders unhappy because it's difficult for them to manage project timelines.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project is being carried out with a focus on figuring out what can be done to address this weakness of mine and applying the findings along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
        All lessons learned so far are highlighted under the section titled "Lesson Learned".
    </p>
    <h2>Project Timeline</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Start Date:</strong> 16 Dec 2024</li>
        <li><strong>Expected Completion Date:</strong> 31 Jan 2025</li>
        <li><strong>Working Hours a Week:</strong> 10-12 hours</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>The project consists of three main components:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>iOSAppInviteAlert</strong> - uses Firebase Cloud Function to receive alerts when someone registers their device to Firebase.</li>
    <li><strong>iOSAppAccessAutomation</strong> - 
    built with Node.js and Postgres, and deployed on Heroku. It manages the email list required by the Firebase CLI to distribute the build.
    </li>
    <li><strong>iOS Build GitHub Workflow</strong> - implemented using GitHub Actions to automate the creation of new provisioning profiles, building the app, and distributing it to testers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Firebase (App Distribution)</strong> and <strong>Apple Developer Account (via Apple Connect API)</strong> are external services that do not require any coding.</p>
<p>Please note that the Node.js service in <strong>iOSAppAccessAutomation</strong> isn't necessary if the emails are managed as <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-distribution/add-remove-testers?platform=ios#add-remove-testers-group" target="_blank">tester groups</a> as the Firebase CLI allows distribution by groups. However, during the assignment, the automation aspect wasn't factored into implementation decisions, which led to the use of a Firebase invite link that doesn't add the user's email to a group. As a result, this automation project needs a service to manage an email list.</p>
<p>iOS Build GitHub Workflow is in <a href="https://github.com/AungThiha/iOSAppAccessAutomation" target="_blank">iOSAppAccessAutomation repo</a>. Normally, it would be in <a href="https://github.com/AungThiha/PhotoAlbumKMP" target="_blank">the KMP project's repo</a> but because the KMP project's repo is submitted as part of the university assignment, it's locked until I get my final result. Once unlocked, iOS Build GitHub Workflow will be moved into the KMP project's repo. This is in May 2025.</p>

    <p>This is used in iOSAppAccessAutomation.</p>
    <h3>Security</h3>
    <h4>Between iOSAppInviteAlert and iOSAppAccessAutomation</h4>
    <p>To ensure only iOSAppInviteAlert can save device information into iOSAppAccessAutomation, an asymmetric encryption called RSA is used. </p>
<p>iOSAppInviteAlert has a private key used for generating JWTs. The private key is saved in Firebase Cloud Secret Manager as iOSAppInviteAlert is a Firebase Cloud Function.</p>
<p>iOSAppAccessAutomation has a public key to verify the JWT sent from iOSAppInviteAlert. iOSAppAccessAutomation will reject a request to save device information if the JWT isn’t signed with the matching private key stored in Firebase Cloud Secret Manager. The public key is stored Heroku configuration variables as iOSAppAccessAutomation is deployed on Heroku.</p>
<p>For an organization, Heroku configuration variables may not be a viable option because Heroku doesn’t provide a way to pick and choose what features of Heroku a team member can have access to. This makes the secret keys visible to anyone who has access to Heroku dashboard. However, for this project, because I’m the sole engineer, this is not an issue.</p>
<p>As a final note on securing communications between iOSAppInviteAlert and iOSAppAccessAutomation, one improvement that can be done is to rotate the RSA keys to minimize the impact if they’re compromised. This will be done as part of learning secure infrastructure management though the exact date for this isn't set yet. Priorities are reviewed every 4 months.</p>
<h4>Between the GitHub workflow and iOSAppAccessAutomation</h4>
<p>Task 13 in the task breakdown is to design the secure communication between the GitHub workflow and iOSAppAccessAutomation, which is not started yet.</p>
    <h2>Edge Case</h2>
    <p>If a user invites themselves using a new email but with a device that's already registered,  Apple Connect API will return an error and iOSAppInviteAlert won't call the Github workflow to create a new build.</p>
    <p>This is not a problem because the latest build will have already been built with a provisioning profile that's configured with the device's UDID since it's already registered.</p>
    <p>However, the new email will replace the existing email in the <strong>Device</strong> table in iOSAppAccessAutomation so that the new email can receive notifications for new builds. It's designed this way because the history of device ownership is not important in this project.</p>
    <p>As for the old email in <strong>User</strong> table, since it won't be cleared, it will continue to receive updates for new builds. This means the user can use either email to access the latest build.</p>
    <h2>Project Revision</h2>
    <p>Initially, it was designed to update the provisioning profile from the Firebase Cloud Function but later, it was found that Apple Connect API does not support updating provisioning profile. It only provides APIs for creating and deleting.</p> 
    <p>Because of it, it's decided to create a new provisioning profile for every build using Github Workflow instead.</p>
    <p>Creating a provisioning profile returns the created provisioning profile as part of the response. Therefore, the task number 3 in the Task Breakdown was discarded.</p>
    <p>The task number 7 is also canceled but because the time spent on this task revealed the missing information that led to this revision, it's still marked as 1 hour spent on this task.</p>
    <p>This revision increased the project timeline by 13 hours.</p>
    <p>The discarded initial design can be found <a href="images/diagram.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The revision happened because during the design task, a third-party API was planned for use without knowing whether such API even exists. Just because APIs for downloading, creating and deleting exist, it cannot be assumed that an API for updating is available as well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Estimation is easier when a big task is broken down into smaller ones. It makes it a lot easier to estimate and makes the estimations more accurate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dedicating time specifically for researching what needs to be done helps convert unknowns into knowns and improves the accuracy of estimates. Such research work should always be done before estimating anything in projects that involve unknowns.
